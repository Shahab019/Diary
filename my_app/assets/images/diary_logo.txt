A_Dairy App Logo
================

This is a placeholder for the app logo.
You can replace this with actual image files like:
- diary_logo.png
- diary_logo.jpg
- app_icon.png

The app currently uses Flutter's built-in Icons.book and Icons.auto_stories
for visual elements throughout the interface.

To add a custom logo:
1. Place your image file in this directory
2. Update pubspec.yaml if needed
3. Use Image.asset('assets/images/your_logo.png') in the code
